# CompArch-Processor

Processor Design Project 

Implementation of a simple custom processor in a programmable microcontroller. Created custom instruction set in Assembly, with instruction codes for arithmetic operations, data movement and deletion, and output to an array of 8 LEDs. Interfaced with a custom Arithmetic Logic Unit programmed into a Programmable Logic Device to perform arithmetic operations. Demonstrated functionality by implementing simple instruction set codes, including an 8 bit counter and a Fibonacci calculator.
